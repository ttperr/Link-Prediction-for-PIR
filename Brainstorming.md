What we want to do:
- 2 validation -> 1 person											Lo/Ti
- 3 ML classification of edges -> 1 person							Tr/Ha
- / report 															anyone
- slides
- 2 adding searches to the logs -> 1/4								first come
- graph analysis
- 2 normalize scores to balance them
<!-- - new dataset -> 1/4												Lo -->
<!-- - 1 more graph based metrics (rooted pagerank & propflow) -> 3/4	Ha/Ti -->
<!-- - 1 validation metrics -> 1/4										Lo -->
<!-- - 2 retrieving more documents -> 1/4 								Tr -->
<!-- - 2 correcting typos -> 1/2											Tr -->
